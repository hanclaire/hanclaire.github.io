      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Golden Hour</p>
      <p>Golden Hour features gold jewelry that is timeless and promotes ethically mined metals. With a focus on sustainability and eco-friendly practices, Golden Hour has a humble location in San Luis Obispo, CA that gives back to their community with every purchase.</p>
      <h2>Target audience</h2>
      <p>This website serves as an only shopping location for those that want to purchase goods with comfort and convenience. This applies to locals and to others that are not from the area that are interested in buying ethically sourced jewelry.</p>
      <p>Golden Hour spreads their knowledge of why someone should purchase ethically mined metals over nonethically mined metals. They want to teach others more about what their business stands for and how their actions can contribute to the wellbeing of people and the earth.</p>
