        <p class="meet">Hi, I'm Claire!</p class="meet">
        <p class="meet">My caffeine story suprisingly did not start the moment I was born. A fun fact, actually, is that I have a caffeine intolerance, but, as you can see, that has never stopped me from drinking it. I fell in love with the tastes, smells, and smoothness of coffee and tea. My passion for both only grew. I discovered matcha a few years back, and I have got to say it is my favorite ingredient to work with right now. Feel free to come on in. I'm always creating new recipes and collaborating with others to test out different flavor combinations or techniques. Maybe your specialty drink can go on the menu one day!</p class="meet">
